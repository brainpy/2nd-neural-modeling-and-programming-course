This model assumes the neuron can only be at **two binary states, i.e., $S_i = +1 / -1$**, representing the neuron can only be either activated or silenced at one time. The neurons are recurrently connected with each other, the connection strength can be expressed as a matrix **$W$**.  \nThe update rule of the network is expressed as,  \n$$S_i(t+1) = sign(\\sum_{j=1}^N W_{ij}S_j(t) - \\theta)$$  \nwhere $\\sum_{j=1}^N W_{ij}S_j(t)$ represents the total recurrent input current the $i_{th}$ neuron receives at time $t$, which in turn determines the neuron state in the next time. Specifically, if the recurrent input exceeds a certain threshold $\\theta$, the neuron state $S_i=1$, otherwise $S_i = -1$.  \nIt should be noted that, the update of different neurons are asynchoronous, which means that at each time only one neuron state will change.  \n\nAmari and Hopfield proved that, to store $n$ different **patterns $\\xi^\\mu (\\mu = 1,2,...n)$** as attractor states in this network, the synaptic weights between i-th an j-th neuron $W_{ij}$ should be:  \n$$W_{ij} = \\sum_{\\mu=1}^n \\xi_i^\\mu \\xi_j^\\mu$$  \nwhere $W_{ii}=0$, representing that neurons do not connect with itself.  \n\nThe energy function $E$ is expressed as,  \n$$ E = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j}W_{ij} S_i S_j + \\theta \\sum_i S_i"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"jupyter":{},"scrolled":false,"tags":[],"slideshow":{"slide_type":"slide"},"id":"3D2D4ACAF9AD4C7991D88335E5F46B27","runtime":{"status":"default","execution_status":null,"is_visible":false},"notebookId":"655933bb671b03a7f562adc0"},"source":"## Costomize Amari-Hopfield Network"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"jupyter":{},"collapsed":false,"scrolled":false,"tags":[],"slideshow":{"slide_type":"slide"},"id":"58FC41DEBDE54C59948C2A3D5FFD2713","notebookId":"655933bb671b03a7f562adc0","trusted":true},"source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nimport brainpy as bp\nimport brainpy.math as bm\n\nclass HopfieldNet(bp.DynamicalSystem):\n  def __init__(self, num):\n    super().__init__()\n    self.num = num\n    self.weight = bm.Variable(bm.zeros([num, num]))\n\n  # Train function for the Hopfield net.
